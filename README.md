# Title - Study of NumPy Library 

## Aim  :
To study and understand the NumPy library in Python and perform operations such as array creation, indexing, slicing, and mathematical computations using NumPy functions.

## Theory :

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source Python library.It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

The core feature of NumPy is the ndarray (N-dimensional array), which allows fast and memory-efficient storage of homogeneous data (elements of the same data type).

***1. Features of NumPy***

Fast execution compared to Python lists.

Supports multi-dimensional arrays.

Requires less memory.

Provides built-in mathematical and statistical functions.

***2. Array Creation***
 
Arrays in NumPy can be created using:

np.array()

np.zeros()

np.ones()

np.arange()

np.linspace()

np.random()


Example:

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])


***3. Array operations***

Mean → np.mean() - The mean is the average value of all elements.

Median → np.median() - The median is the middle value when elements are arranged in order.

Standard Deviation → np.std() - Standard deviation measures how much the data values vary from the mean.

Sum → np.sum() - Returns the total of all elements.

Minimum → np.min() - Returns the smallest value in the array.

Maximum → np.max() - Returns the largest value in the array. 

## Conclusion

NumPy allows us to perform fast mathematical, statistical, logical, and matrix operations on arrays. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing because of its speed and efficiency.
